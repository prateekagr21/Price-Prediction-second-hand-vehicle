# Predicting Price of Second hand Vehicles.
## Making a Model for Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms.

### This Project of mine involves :

- Loading the dataset and checking for null values.
- Doing Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Visualization of considerable factors.

- Making dummy variables.
- Finding Correlations.
- Plotting a heatmap from that correlation.
- And a Pairplot for understanding the data better.

## Now Making the model for predicting the price :
