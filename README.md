# Predicting Price of Second hand Vehicles.
## Making a Model for Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms.

### This Project of mine involves :

- Loading the dataset and checking for null values.
- Doing Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Visualization of considerable factors.

#### Analysis :
- Making dummy variables.
- Finding Correlations.
- Plotting a heatmap from that correlation.
- And a Pairplot for understanding the data better.

## Feature Engineering :
- Independent and Dependent features were made.
- Done the Train-Testt split.

# Now Making the model for predicting the price :

## Extra Tree Regressor model
- Fitted the model
- It was used for finding out the important features.
- Plotted the Important Features.

## RandomForest Regressor
Selected parameters using 
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- And RandomizedSearchCV

## And Now, for the Prediction,
- Fitted the model
Looked for the :
- best parameters 
- and Scores.

#### Plotted the Model using Seaborn Library
- Normal Distribution curve was formed.

## And at last , looked for the errors:
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- Root Mean Squared Error
